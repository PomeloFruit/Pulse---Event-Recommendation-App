Additionally, is the Android Studios Project that I worked on while at the Hatchery. It includes only the Android Activities that I was responsible for and not the entire prototype. 
Included in the Android Studios project are: 
- The four main home navigation screens of the app with a bottom navigation bar to access them 
- The Event Information Page
- Login and Sign-out system with Facebook, Google Play and Firebase services/API
